# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The API service layer (apiClient.js and companyService.js) is properly implemented with authentication handling and token refresh logic. However, there appears to be an issue with the authentication flow when making API calls from the frontend. While the login endpoint works correctly, subsequent API calls to company endpoints return 403 Forbidden errors. This suggests that either the token is not being properly stored/used in the frontend, or there's an issue with the token validation on the backend. The backend API endpoints themselves are working correctly when tested directly with proper authentication."

While the login endpoint works correctly, subsequent API calls to company endpoints return 403 Forbidden errors. This suggests that either the token is not being properly stored/used in the frontend, or there's an issue with the token validation on the backend. The issue appears to be related to token storage inconsistency: AuthContext.js stores tokens as 'qb_access_token' and 'qb_refresh_token', but apiClient.js looks for 'accessToken' and 'refreshToken'. This mismatch is likely causing the authentication failures. The API service layer (apiClient.js and companyService.js) is properly implemented with authentication handling and token refresh logic, but needs to be updated to use the same token storage keys as AuthContext.js."

      message: "🔧 TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION FIXES APPLIED: Fixed all identified backend issues from Phase 1.4 testing. ✅ FIXES COMPLETED: 1) Fix #1 - Update Operations: Fixed line data serialization issue in update_transaction method by properly converting Pydantic models to dictionaries and ensuring line_number fields are handled correctly. 2) Fix #2 - Payment Creation: Added proper async await handling in _update_transaction_balance method with database flush operations. Enhanced payment creation to include applications relationship loading. 3) Fix #3 - Error Handling: Improved company access verification with better exception handling and logging. Added proper error handling in BaseListService verify_company_access method. 4) Fix #4 - Schema Updates: Added missing line_number field to TransactionLineUpdate schema and improved line creation logic in updates. All backend API endpoints should now work correctly with proper error handling and data serialization. Ready for comprehensive backend testing to verify fixes."

      message: "✅ TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of the Transaction Management Integration APIs after fixes shows significant improvements. The update operations for transactions, invoices, and bills now work correctly with 200 status codes. The line data serialization issue has been resolved. All core operations (create, read, post, void, delete) continue to work correctly for transactions, invoices, and bills. However, there are still two remaining issues: 1) Payment Creation: Still has validation errors related to the applications field with error message: 'Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of PaymentApplicationSchema'. 2) Error Handling: Invalid company IDs still return 500 errors instead of 403/404 status codes. Despite these remaining issues, the critical update operations are now working correctly, which was the main focus of the fixes. The application can now properly create, read, update, post, void, and delete transactions, invoices, and bills."

      message: "🧪 PHASE 2.1 DASHBOARD INTEGRATION API TESTING COMPLETED: Testing of the new dashboard integration APIs revealed mixed results. 1) Dashboard API (/api/companies/{company_id}/reports/dashboard): The endpoint is implemented but has a timeout issue, failing to respond within 10 seconds. This suggests a performance issue or an infinite loop in the implementation. 2) Enhanced Transactions API with recent=true parameter: Works correctly, properly limiting results to 10 transactions and sorting by created_at desc. 3) Enhanced Invoices API with status filtering: Partially working - 'outstanding' and 'overdue' filters work correctly, but 'paid' filter returns invoices with balance_due > 0, which contradicts expected behavior. The API structure and response format are correct for all endpoints, but the dashboard API needs performance optimization and the paid invoices filter needs fixing."

      message: "🎉 PHASE 2.1 DASHBOARD INTEGRATION FIXES COMPLETED: Successfully fixed the two identified API issues from Phase 2.1 testing. ✅ FIXES APPLIED: 1) Dashboard API Performance Issue: Optimized SQL queries by combining multiple separate queries into a single query using SQLAlchemy case expressions. Added proper error handling and logging. The API now responds in under 5 seconds (except 'this-year' at 5.35 seconds) instead of timing out after 10 seconds. 2) Enhanced Invoices API Paid Status Filter: Fixed Decimal comparison issue by changing integer 0 comparisons to Decimal('0') for balance_due field. This ensures proper filtering of paid invoices with balance_due == Decimal('0'). Both fixes maintain existing functionality while improving performance and data accuracy."

      message: "🎯 PHASE 2.2 DASHBOARD FRONTEND INTEGRATION COMPLETED: Successfully integrated frontend dashboard with fixed backend APIs. The dashboard is already well-structured and properly connects to the optimized backend endpoints. ✅ INTEGRATION POINTS: 1) Dashboard uses dashboardService.getDashboardSummary() to fetch data from GET /api/companies/{id}/reports/dashboard with proper date range filtering 2) Recent transactions loaded via dashboardService.getRecentTransactions() using GET /api/companies/{id}/transactions?recent=true 3) Outstanding invoices loaded via dashboardService.getOutstandingInvoices() using GET /api/companies/{id}/invoices?status=outstanding 4) Dashboard alerts generated from multiple API endpoints with proper error handling 5) All components include loading states, error handling, and refresh functionality 6) Real-time data updates when date range changes 7) Proper integration with CompanyContext for company-scoped data. The dashboard displays real-time financial data from the backend including total income, expenses, net income, outstanding invoices, accounts receivable aging, recent transactions, and system alerts. Ready for comprehensive testing of the integrated dashboard experience."

API now responds in under 5 seconds for most date ranges (5.35 seconds for 'this-year' which is still much better than previous timeouts). Response structure includes all required elements. 2) Enhanced Transactions API (/api/companies/{company_id}/transactions/?recent=true): ✅ WORKING - Continues to work correctly with proper limiting to 10 transactions and sorting by created_at desc. 3) Enhanced Invoices API (/api/companies/{company_id}/invoices?status=paid): ❌ AUTHENTICATION ISSUE - Returns 403 Forbidden errors, likely due to token expiration rather than the fix itself. The Decimal comparison fix appears to be correctly implemented but couldn't be fully verified due to authentication issues. Overall, the major performance issue with the Dashboard API has been successfully resolved."
